      <h3>Congress is full of assholes</h3>
      <p>We're talking about politicians who pretend climate change isn't real, that guns are a basic human right, but healthcare isn't.</p>
      <h3>Their corporate backers are to blame</h3>
      <p>The assholes didnâ€™t just appear out of nowhere. They are groomed and paid for by giant corporations who don't care about us or our democracy.</p>
      <h3>They're using our money to do it</h3>
      <p>We buy all kinds of products from these same corporations and bankroll this whole process.</p>
