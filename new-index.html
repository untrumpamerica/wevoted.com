      <h3>Congress is full of assholes</h3>
      <p>We're talking about politicians who pretend climate change isn't real, that guns are a basic human right, but healthcare isn't.</p>
      <h3>Their corporate backers are to blame</h3>
      <p>These assholes didn’t just appear out of nowhere. They are groomed and paid for by giant corporations who don't care about us or our democracy.</p>
      <h3>They're using our money to do it</h3>
      <p>Everyone buys all kinds of products from these same corporations and bankrolls this whole process.</p>
      <h3>No more. We sell our own products and use the money to beat them.</h3>
      <p>We make great, all natural home products, and instead of using a small amount of the money to prop up old Mitch McConnell, we use a lot of it to take politicians like him down.</p>
      <h3>Let's fight back</h3>
      <p>We take half our profits and funnel them into our superpac (that's right, we have a superpac) and attack terrible politicians for their corrupt, cynical behavior. This will involve video, direct action, and we're gonna have some fun with it.</p>
      <h3>This isn't a pipe dream</h3>
      <p>We're really doing it. Our plan is to start small, selling a few basic home products, and we want you to take this ride with us.</p>
      <p>If we can persuade a million people to replace just a few of their "pro Mitch McConnell" products with our "fuck Mitch McConnell" products and to keep doing it every month via a subscription service, this thing will be a really big deal.</p>
      <h3>Does this sound like something you'd like to be involved with? We're hiring.</h3>
      <p>Drop us a line, we’d love to hear from you. <a href="mailto:contact@wevoted.com">contact@wevoted.com</a></p>
